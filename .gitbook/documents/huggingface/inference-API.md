# Serverless Inference API

Instant Access to thousands of ML Models for Fast Prototyping

Explore the most popular models for text, image, speech, and more — all with a simple API request. Build, test, and experiment without worrying about infrastructure or setup.

## Why use the Inference API?

The Serverless Inference API offers a fast and free way to explore thousands of models for a variety of tasks. Whether you’re prototyping a new application or experimenting with ML capabilities, this API gives you instant access to high-performing models across multiple domains:

Text Generation: Including large language models and tool-calling prompts, generate and experiment with high-quality responses.
Image Generation: Easily create customized images, including LoRAs for your own styles.
Document Embeddings: Build search and retrieval systems with SOTA embeddings.
Classical AI Tasks: Ready-to-use models for text classification, image classification, speech recognition, and more.
⚡ Fast and Free to Get Started: The Inference API is free with higher rate limits for PRO users. For production needs, explore Inference Endpoints for dedicated resources, autoscaling, advanced security features, and more.
