# README - Sound.mp3

## Step 1: Repository Structure

## 1.	Create a GitHub Repository:
	•	Repository name: sound-host
	•	Upload the file start-sound.mp3 to the root directory.
## 2.	File Structure:

	sound-host/
	├── start-sound.mp3  # Your audio file
	└── README.md        # Optional documentation


## 3.	Enable GitHub Pages:
	•	In Settings of your sound-host repository, enable GitHub Pages by selecting the main branch and the root folder.
	•	GitHub will provide a URL like:

https://Exios66.github.io/sound-host/


	•	The audio file will be accessible at:

https://Exios66.github.io/sound-host/start-sound.mp3



Step 2: Python Code for the Assistant

Here’s the updated Python code to fetch and play the audio file hosted on your GitHub Pages.

Python Code:

import requests
import os
from playsound import playsound

# URL of the hosted sound file on GitHub Pages
SOUND_URL = 'https://Exios66.github.io/sound-host/start-sound.mp3'

def fetch_and_play_sound():
    # File to save the sound locally
    local_sound_file = 'start-sound.mp3'
    
    # Fetch the sound file from GitHub Pages
    try:
        response = requests.get(SOUND_URL)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Ensure the request was successful
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching the sound file: {e}")
        return
    
    # Save the file locally
    with open(local_sound_file, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
        print(f"Sound file saved as {local_sound_file}")
    
    # Play the sound using the local file
    try:
        playsound(local_sound_file)
        print("Sound played successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error playing the sound: {e}")

    # Optionally delete the local sound file after playing
    if os.path.exists(local_sound_file):
        os.remove(local_sound_file)
        print(f"Local file {local_sound_file} deleted.")

# Example usage: Call this function when the assistant needs to play the sound
fetch_and_play_sound()

Step 3: Instructions to Set Up GitHub Pages

	1.	Create a GitHub Repository:
	•	Create a new public repository on GitHub named sound-host.
	2.	Upload the MP3 File:
	•	Drag and drop start-sound.mp3 into the root of the repository.
	3.	Enable GitHub Pages:
	•	Navigate to Settings of your repository.
	•	Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
	•	Under “Source,” choose the main branch and set the root folder.
	•	GitHub will provide a URL like:

https://Exios66.github.io/sound-host/


	•	Your MP3 file will now be accessible at:

https://Exios66.github.io/sound-host/start-sound.mp3



Python Code Explanation:

	•	SOUND_URL: This is the URL pointing to the hosted start-sound.mp3 file on GitHub Pages.
	•	requests.get: The sound file is downloaded from this URL and saved locally.
	•	playsound: The saved file is played back locally.
	•	Cleanup: The local file is deleted after playing to avoid clutter.

Final Steps:

	1.	Test the GitHub Pages URL:
	•	Ensure you can access your sound file via this link:
https://Exios66.github.io/sound-host/start-sound.mp3
	2.	Integrate into the Assistant:
	•	Add the Python script into your assistant’s knowledge base or environment.
	•	Call fetch_and_play_sound() wherever the assistant needs to play the sound.
	3.	Dependencies:
Make sure requests and playsound are installed in your environment:

pip install requests playsound



This setup will now allow your assistant to fetch and play the sound file from your GitHub Pages repository each time it’s triggered.
