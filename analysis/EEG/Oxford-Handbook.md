Abstract

This handbook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of research on event-related potential (ERP) components, which are critical in the analysis of cognitive, sensory, and motor processes through brain activity recordings. This reference addresses defining, isolating, and interpreting ERP components for both introductory and experienced ERP researchers, covering a broad array of components, methodologies, and applications across neuroscience.

Keywords

 • Event-related potential (ERP)
 • ERP component
 • Peaks
 • Waves
 • Reverse inference

Comprehensive Content Breakdown

Preface and Handbook Goals

The Oxford Handbook of Event-Related Potential Components was developed to consolidate over 100,000 ERP studies, which have identified major components like P300, N170, N400, and P600. The editors structured the handbook to act as an ongoing reference, allowing researchers to access detailed information about specific ERP components and methodologies, and to better understand how various ERP components respond to neurocognitive processes. Key objectives are to facilitate ERP research design and interpretation, helping researchers determine which components best answer specific experimental questions.

Organization of the Handbook

The handbook is divided into four primary sections:

 1. Foundational Concepts: Defines ERP components, explores EEG oscillations, and introduces mathematical methods like Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
 2. Core ERP Components: Focuses on specific components frequently isolated in experiments, including sensory components, P300, and error-related negativity.
 3. Psychological Domains: Examines ERP applications in domains like memory, language, and emotion, offering researchers domain-specific ERP insights.
 4. ERP Variability Across Populations: Looks at how ERP components manifest across age, developmental stages, and neurological conditions, assisting in population-specific studies.

Key Concepts and Terminology

 1. ERP Component: A distinct, scalp-recorded electrical signal reflecting specific neural processes.
 2. Peak and Waveform: Though visible as discrete peaks, ERP components are continuous waveforms generated by overlapping neural processes.
 3. Source Localization, ICA, and PCA: Methodologies used to mathematically isolate ERP components from recorded brain activity data.
 4. Event-Related Potentials and EEG: ERPs are generated by electrical potentials in the brain’s cortex, primarily observed through EEG, which provides real-time recording of neural responses to stimuli.

Challenges in ERP Research

One of the core challenges in ERP analysis is component overlap. ERP waveforms reflect multiple components that sum together, often making it difficult to attribute specific cognitive functions to distinct components. The handbook addresses these issues with examples and methodological guidelines for improving accuracy in component isolation and analysis, especially for newer researchers.

Research Design and Practical Application

For cognitive neuroscientists and psychologists, this volume offers methodological tools to design experiments, interpret ERP data, and select ERP components that can most effectively test hypotheses about brain processes. Researchers can apply this knowledge in diverse fields, including developmental psychology, language processing, and clinical psychology.

Major Takeaways

 • Comprehensive Resource: The handbook serves as a detailed repository for ERP research, designed to accommodate evolving researcher needs.
 • Methodological Rigor: Emphasizes precision in ERP component isolation and offers mathematical models and analytic strategies.
 • Interdisciplinary Applications: Though neuroscience-centered, ERP methodology can be adapted to related fields such as linguistics and psychopathology.
