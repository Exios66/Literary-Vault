## Abstract

The article presents the development of a VR-based flight simulator designed to assess cognitive load using ocular and EEG data. The simulator integrates realistic air combat simulations and provides cognitive load feedback based on pupil dilation, gaze fixation, and EEG-derived indices. The study involved 12 test pilots and showed that both EEG and ocular data are correlated with perceived task difficulty, suggesting the simulator’s efficacy in cognitive load assessment.
