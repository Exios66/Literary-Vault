## Abstract and Keywords
This paper addresses the ethical complexities inherent in misinformation research. The authors propose a framework of “Three D’s”—Deception, Dialogue, and Debriefing—as essential principles for conducting ethical misinformation studies. They highlight the need to balance the use of deception, ensuring informed consent through continuous dialogue, and enhancing transparency by implementing comprehensive debriefing processes. The article also suggests that adopting stronger ethical practices benefits both the individual researcher and the integrity of the field.

## Key Quotes
1. "Researchers should consider making re-consent a part of their standard practice following debriefing."
2. "In our personal experience, it is very rare that participants choose to opt out following debriefing; in fact, many report finding the study more interesting after."
3. "It is essential that misinformation researchers assess the participant feedback on ethical practices to refine methods continually."
4. "Ethics approval is not a one-time check; ongoing dialogue and participant feedback are equally essential."
5. "Transparency in the use of deception helps maintain public trust in misinformation research."

## Questions and Answers
1. **Why is deception used in misinformation research?**  
   Deception helps create realistic conditions to study misinformation’s impact without alerting participants, which could influence their behavior.
   
2. **How can researchers maintain ethical transparency?**  
   By incorporating post-study dialogue, researchers can gauge participant perspectives on the ethics of the study.
   
3. **What is the role of debriefing in misinformation studies?**  
   Debriefing aims to retract false beliefs formed during the study and clarify the study’s true objectives to the participants.
   
4. **Why is informed consent complicated in misinformation studies?**  
   True informed consent is challenging because disclosing a study's true nature can bias participant responses.
   
5. **What are the risks of misinformation interventions in research?**  
   Interventions may create skepticism towards real news, affecting participants' trust in legitimate information sources.
