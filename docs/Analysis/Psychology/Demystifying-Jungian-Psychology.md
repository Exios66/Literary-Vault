### Chapter 1: The Foundations of Jungian Psychology
This foundational chapter sets the philosophical and methodological stage for Jung’s work, covering Jung's **empirical approach and epistemology**. Krüger explores Jung’s avoidance of fixed theories, preferring a descriptive approach that acknowledges psychological phenomena without attempting to reduce them to simple formulas. Key subsections include:

- **1.1 Epistemology**: Emphasizes Jung’s empirical and phenomenological standpoint, focusing on observation over metaphysical speculation.
- **1.2 Learned Nominalism**: Discusses Jung’s pragmatic use of terminology, not as fixed definitions but as practical tools to navigate complex psychic phenomena.
- **1.3 Psychic Reality**: Delves into Jung’s notion that our experiences are mediated by psychic images, positioning the psyche as an intermediary between sensory and spiritual reality.
- **1.4 Reply to Martin Buber**: Addresses Jung’s response to accusations of mysticism by clarifying his stance as an empiricist.

This chapter emphasizes Jung’s non-reductive approach to psychology, setting a clear boundary between empirical observations and metaphysical interpretations.

- **2.2 Complexes**: Discusses complexes as fragmented parts of the psyche, particularly the autonomous, often disruptive, forces within an individual’s personality.
