Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your Personal Information with third parties without your consent for marketing purposes. We share personal information with vendors performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications, who are provided access to the user’s email address for sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and under our Privacy Policy.\
In general, the Personal Information you provide us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback, provide technical support, and inform users about promotional offers.\
We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.

_**`Non-Personal Information:`**_

In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers, and other third parties at our discretion.\
If we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices.

## III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION

We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.

We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing specific technological security measures, including encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of such firewalls and secure server software. Using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
