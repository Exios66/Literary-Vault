### `Abstract`

In an era where artificial intelligence increasingly serves as a primary information source, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying human information processing during AI interactions has become crucial for both theoretical neuroscience and public welfare. While extensive research exists on behavioral responses to misinformation and general human-AI interaction, a critical gap remains in our understanding of the neurological signatures associated with information verification processes. This study presents a novel multi-modal investigation combining high-density electroencephalography (`EEG`), eye-tracking metrics, and peripheral physiological measurements to map the neural architecture of human information processing during AI interactions.

Our study explores participants' brain responses across five key knowledge areas using advanced AI chatbots with distinct behavioral patterns. We systematically adjust the accuracy of the information provided during the analysis. This innovative research initiative seeks to unravel key questions surrounding human-AI information processing dynamics. The study not only offers groundbreaking insights into how individuals interact with AI-driven content but also provides practical implications for the development and enhancement of digital literacy programs. By understanding how people process and respond to varying levels of information accuracy, educators and policymakers can design more effective strategies to foster critical thinking and discernment in digital communication. Furthermore, this research will contribute to a deeper comprehension of cognitive and neurological aspects of information processing, paving the way for the integration of AI systems that effectively complement human knowledge and learning processes. Ultimately, our findings aim to advance educational frameworks and empower users with the skills needed to navigate the increasingly complex digital landscape with confidence and critical acuity.

### `Introduction`

#### The Challenge of Our Time

In the contemporary information landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have emerged as influential mediators of knowledge, fundamentally reshaping the way humans access, interpret, and process information. This transformative role of AI creates unprecedented opportunities for enhanced learning, problem-solving, and innovation. However, it also introduces significant challenges for human cognition, particularly in the realms of discernment and critical thinking.

As the volume of information available online grows exponentially, the ability to differentiate accurate from inaccurate information has become a vital survival skill in the digital age. The stakes are high, as misinformation can lead to decisions that have far-reaching consequences in areas such as politics, health, and environmental management. Despite the critical nature of this skill, our understanding of the neural mechanisms that underpin the process of distinguishing between true and false information remains remarkably limited.

In exploring this domain, it is crucial to investigate how individuals process information, what cognitive biases may affect their judgments, and how AI systems can be designed to support rather than undermine this discernment. Moreover, interdisciplinary research is needed to unravel the complexities of human cognitive function in the context of AI-mediated information. As we continue to integrate AI into various facets of daily life, addressing these challenges will be integral to ensuring that technology serves to enhance, rather than hinder, our cognitive capabilities.

Previous research has conclusively documented behavioral responses to misinformation (Smith et al., 2022) and patterns of human-AI trust development (Zhang et al., 2021). These studies, however, have centered primarily on observable outcomes instead of delving into the underlying neural mechanisms. While they provide valuable insights into how misinformation affects user behavior and the factors contributing to trust between humans and AI systems, they do not address the biological processes that occur during these interactions. This gap in understanding has limited the ability to develop interventions that can modify these processes at a fundamental level. With recent advancements in neuroscience, specific electroencephalography (EEG) signatures linked to information processing have been identified (Johnson & Lee, 2023). These discoveries have opened new avenues for exploring the cognitive and emotional processes involved when individuals engage with AI. EEG technology offers real-time monitoring of brain activity, allowing researchers to observe how the brain responds to different types of information, including misinformation. This could lead to new strategies for mitigating the negative impacts of misinformation by understanding how it affects neural activity.

Despite these significant findings, a systematic application of EEG and other neuroscience tools to the study of human-AI interactions remains in its infancy. More comprehensive research is necessary to bridge the gap between behavioral studies and cognitive neuroscience. Such research could deepen our understanding of how neural mechanisms influence trust-building and decision-making in human-AI interactions. Exploring these neural correlates may ultimately inform the design of AI systems that can better align with human cognitive and emotional processes

#### The Critical Gap

Despite the wealth of research in adjacent fields, there exists a crucial void in our understanding of:

1. Real-time neural markers of information validation during human-AI interaction
2. Integration of multiple physiological measures in truth detection processes
3. Individual differences in neural processing of AI-provided information
4. Comprehensive models linking neural activity to successful misinformation detection

## Research Significance
