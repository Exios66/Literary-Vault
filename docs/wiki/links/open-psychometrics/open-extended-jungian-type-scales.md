Introduction:

&#x20;Carl Jung (1875-1961) was Swiss psychiatrist who proposed a theory of psychological types. His theory was taken and extended by Katharine Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Myers, personality enthusiasts who had studied his work extensively. They developed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator which classified people into 16 different types on the basis of four dichotomies: Introversion-Extroversion, Sensing-Intuition, Thinking-Feeling, and Judging-Perceiving. The first three were adapted from Jung and the last developed by Myers-Briggs. So, for example, a person could be Extroverted-Sensing-Feeling-Perceiving (ESFP) or Introverted-iNtuiting-Thinking-Judging (INTJ). The Myers-Briggs types are the most popular pop-psych system. The Open Extended Jungian Type Scales was developed as an open source alternative to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. A [statistical comparison](http://openpsychometrics.org/tests/OEJTS/comparison/) of the OEJTS with three other on-line MBTI alternatives found that the OEJTS was the most accurate.

Procedure: This test has 60 items in two sections. In the first section, each of the items consists of two opposing personality descriptions (e.g. honest ..... a liar) put on two the ends of a five point scale. For each item you must select an interval on that scale that you think best reflects your personality; from all of one, to a mix of the two, to all of the other. In the second section, you will be given items in the first person (e.g. "I love ice cream") and asked to rate how much you think each is true. It should take most people about 5-7 minutes.

Participation: You use of this assessment should be for educational or entertainment purposes only. This is not psychological advice of any kind. Additionally, your responses to this questionnaire will be anonymously saved and possibly used for research or otherwise distributed.
