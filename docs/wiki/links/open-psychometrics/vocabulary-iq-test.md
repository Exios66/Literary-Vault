This is an interactive vocabulary test that gives results in the form of an IQ score.

Introduction: "Intelligence Quotient" is a way of reporting cognitive ability test scores so that they can be easily compared across tests in a way that automatically takes into account the difficulty of each test. Raw scores are converted onto a scale where the average is set to be 100, and the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard\_deviation) is 15 (this forces a certain percentage of people to fall within certain score ranges).

IQ tests usually contain many different tests and are organized into different abilities. But this is not a [Full Scale IQ Test](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/), just specifically a vocabulary test. Vocabulary is usually considered a good measure of Verbal-ability/Verbal-IQ, but may not be an accurate measure for non-native English speakers or people with unusual educational upbringings.

Procedure: The test has 45 questions. In each question you are given five words and asked to select two that have the same meaning. You get penalized for wrong answers, so if you do not know, select "don't know".
